# OpenAI Gym Game using Intelligent Reflex Agents

Implemented two simple reflex agents for Atari game called "Berzerk".

To run the game, install OpenAI's gym library.
The installation instructions and quick starters guide can be found here at,
https://gym.openai.com/docs/

Place the Berzerk.py inside the Gym folder to run. This file can run without importing any other file from my repository.

Files to check in sequence to better understand the project -
"Code information.txt"
"Berzerk Report.pdf"
"Berzerk.py"
"analysis.ipynb"

Other files are datafiles generated by running the game for 1000 iterations. So be careful while editing it.
It is only used in "analysis.ipynb" file. 

Enjoy the game.
